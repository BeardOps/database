Chunk Out
---------
1999 James Todd
for Bung Coding Competition 2 1999

General Gameplay:
-----------------

The general idea of the game is to delete as many tiles as possible,
in as large chunks as possible. The score works like so:

		tot_score = (n-1)^2
		(where n is number of tiles > 1)

If all tiles are erased in a game, a bonus of 1000 points will be
added to your score. A good score in this game is 2500+. To delete
tiles, move the cursor around and press the A button. NB, chunks must
be bigger than 1 tile!
