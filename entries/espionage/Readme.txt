Intro
==================================================

Made for the GBJAM (http://gbjam.net/).    

You play as a spy as he makes his way into the 
enemy base to collect as much data as he can; but 
don't get too greedy, because he needs to get out 
before the timer runs out and the enemy back up 
arrives.

==================================================
How to Play
==================================================

To run the .gb file you will need a Game Boy emulator 
(http://bgb.bircd.org/)
