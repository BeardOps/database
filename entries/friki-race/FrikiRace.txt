
FRIKI RACE
by Enrique Sanchez Rosa

This is my contribution to Bung's 2nd Amateur GB Game Coding Competition,
in September 1999. It is a pretty simple car racing game, in which you
must reach the goal in time through 3 different stages. Also you have to
overtake as many rivals as possible to become the first in the ranking.

This game has been designed to be compatible with all Game Boy models,
but it will show enhanced coloured graphics when played with Game Boy Color.

Controls are:   pad left & right     ---> move the car
                pad up or A button   ---> accelerate
                pad down or B button ---> brake
                start (during game)  ---> pause

I accept full responsability for the legality of this game, which
does not contain any copyrighted material, trademarks or icons which I do
not have the rights to use.
Also I hereby grant Bung Enterprises full rights to distribute the ROM
file without my prior consent, as long as it is distributed as freeware and
no fee is charged for it at all.

The game has been developed using Carsten Sorensen's RGBDS v1.10. The
included file FRIKIRC.ASM contains the game's source code to prove its
authenticity. This file alone can't be assembled, as many data files
(*.BIN) containing graphics, tables and other binary data must be present.
I won't provide these files unless it is strictly neccesary. However every
program routine of the game is included in FRIKIRC.ASM, so I think it is
enough to prove authenticity.



PS: In case you're wondering what 'friki' means, it is Spanish slang for
'freak'.
