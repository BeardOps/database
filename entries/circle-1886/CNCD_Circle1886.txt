Music, graphics and programming by Aleksi Eeben
HiColour Convertor written by Glen Cook


The intro won't work correctly on any software emulator!

If you don't own a Game Boy Color try the VGBC emulator by Rusty Wagner.

'cncd.gif' is included to give some idea of what the end part looks like
on the real hardware.
